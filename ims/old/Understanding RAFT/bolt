bolt db a local storage engine


Bolt in itself is the storage for etcd.

every etcd node has its separate storage

etcd built upon BoltDB & this is where the key-value pairs are stored.

BoltDB is the storage where values can be found from keys

BoltDB organises data and makes finding data easier

Each ETCD NODE maintains local storage & BoltDB interacts with data in local storage stored using BoltDB

boltdb is:
fast
efficient
reads key-values data
storage for every server/node

REQUEST TO STORE/GET DATA
|-> ETCD
	|-> BoltDB
		  |-> Checks local storage where data stored using BoltDB
	
Bolt = NOTEBOOK
Info written on pages
most pages moved to cache for fast
if cache =/= data then page checked
fast when reading, slow when writing as where to write needs to be searched
