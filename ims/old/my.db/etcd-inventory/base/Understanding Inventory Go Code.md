Understanding Inventory Go Code

STEPS:

1. //Setting File paths
2. // Open the Excel file
3. // Create the CSV file
4. // Write data to the CSV file
5. // Iterate over sheets and rows in the Excel file
6. // Check if the row is empty
7. // Skip empty rows
8. // Connect to etcd
9. // Read the CSV file
10. // Parse the CSV file
11. // Iterate over the records and upload to etcd
12. .// Create server data dictionary
13. // Set key-value pairs in etcd for each data field
14. // Set key-value pair for server data
15. // Extract the server type and IP from the URL path
16. //Connect to etcd
17. // Construct the etcd key for the server data
18. // Get the server data from etcd
19. // Check if the key exists
20. // Extract the server data value
21. // Extract the specific field value from the server data
22. // Write the field value as the response
23. // Convert Excel to CSV
24. // Parse command-line flags
25. // Upload CSV data to etcd
26. // Start API server



1. The code imports various packages that provide useful functionalities to the program.
2. The code declares variables to store file paths and the host address of an etcd server.
3. There is a function called `convertExcelToCSV` that converts an Excel file to a CSV file. It opens the Excel file, creates a CSV file, and copies the data from the Excel file to the CSV file.
4. The code has a function named `uploadToEtcd` that connects to an etcd server, reads a CSV file, and uploads the data from the CSV file to the etcd server. It organizes the data in a specific format and stores it in the etcd server.
5. There is a function called `getServerData` that handles HTTP requests to retrieve server data from the etcd server. It extracts server-related information from the request URL, connects to the etcd server, retrieves the requested data, and sends it back as a response.
6. Another function called `getRevisionValues` is used to retrieve specific versions of a key from the etcd server. It takes a list of revisions as input, fetches the corresponding values from the etcd server, and returns them.
7. The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It converts an Excel file to a CSV file, parses command-line flags, uploads CSV data to the etcd server, and starts an API server to handle requests for server data.
