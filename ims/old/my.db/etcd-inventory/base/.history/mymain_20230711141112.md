# Understanding 'Main.go'

It imports various packages that are required for the program.

1. It defines a type `ServerData` as a map of strings.
3. It declares and initializes variables for file paths (`excelFile`, `csvFile`) and the host address of etcd (`etcdHost`).
4. It defines a function `convertExcelToCSV` that converts an Excel file to a CSV file.
   * It opens the Excel file specified by `excelFile`.
   * It creates a new CSV file specified by `csvFile`.
   * It writes the data from the Excel file to the CSV file.
5. It defines a function `uploadToEtcd` that uploads data from the CSV file to etcd.
   * It connects to the etcd server using the specified `etcdHost`.
   * It opens the CSV file specified by `csvFile`.
   * It reads the CSV file and parses the records.
   * It iterates over the records and uploads the data to etcd.
   * It sets key-value pairs in etcd for each data field.
   * It sets a key-value pair for the server data in etcd.
6. It defines a function `getServerData` that handles HTTP requests to retrieve server data from etcd.
   * It extracts the server type and IP from the URL path.
   * It connects to the etcd server using the specified `etcdHost`.
   * It constructs the etcd key for the server data.
   * It retrieves the server data from etcd.
   * It checks if the key exists and extracts the server data value.
   * It extracts the specific field value from the server data.
   * It writes the field value as the response.
7. It defines the `main` function.
   * It converts the Excel file to CSV using the `convertExcelToCSV` function.
   * It parses command-line flags.
   * It uploads the CSV data to etcd using the `uploadToEtcd` function.
   * It starts an HTTP server to handle API requests and calls the `getServerData` function to retrieve server data from etcd.
   * It listens for incoming requests on port 8080 and logs any errors that occur.

In summary, the code converts an Excel file to a CSV file, uploads the CSV data to an etcd server, and provides an API to retrieve server data from etcd based on server type, IP, and specific field.
